    <string name="gameRulesBonusITitle">Move</string>
    <string name="gameRulesBonusIITitle">Replay</string>
    <string name="gameRulesBonusIIITitle">Big Bomb</string>

    <string name="gameRulesGeneral">How do we play ? I\'ll tell you now...</string>
    <string name="gameRulesPrinciple">Start to place your blocks on the grid - you can even rotate it by clicking on it.\nThen, try to destroy all the blocks of your opponent. If you hit a block, you play again.</string>
    <string name="gameRulesLevels">Andy will be your lovely opponent: you will play against him.</string>
    <string name="gameRulesSubtilities">3 Bonus are hidden on the map at strategic places. Shot the cell with a bonus to get it, and press the corresponding button during your turn to use it !\nYou can use it only once, so think twice.</string>

    <string name="gameRulesLevelITitle">The level Nice - Slowly but not too much</string>
    <string name="gameRulesLevelIITitle">The level Less Nice - Holidays are over</string>
    <string name="gameRulesLevelIIITitle">The Level Not Nice - No civilians allowed</string>
    <string name="gameRulesLevelImpoTitle">Level Impossible - Masochistic and police only</string>

    <string name="gameRulesLevelI">The Level Nice is - as the name suggests it - mostly nice: everyone shots randomly and no one wins...\nWell, I wouldn\'t underestimate Andy nonetheless ...</string>
    <string name="gameRulesLevelII">The Level Less Nice is - surprise, surprise - mostly less nice: Andy scratches its head before every shot and the defeat shouldn\'t be excluded anymore ... Will you dare to meet the challenge ?"</string>
    <string name="gameRulesLevelIII">The Level Not Nice is - suspense, suspense - really not nice: Andy brings its statistics studies and your horoscope to know it all.\nPlus, he applies random colors on blocks before starting the game.</string>
    <string name="gameRulesLevelImpo">Challenge to your ego or insult to your intellect ?\nThat\'s up to you - write 105 times the word challenge on your paper and discuss it with your left neighbour until the end of the class.</string>

    <string name="gameRulesBonusI">This bonus let you - I swear it\'s true - to move all the blocks or rotate (if there is enough space).\nNote that you can\'t place it on a case already played; so I advise you to find this bonus at the beginning of the game (I don\'t make the rules, I merely write it).</string>
    <string name="gameRulesBonusII">This bonus let you - a totally crazy thing - to play again. Well, if you miss. When you miss, you play again.\nAnd if you miss again, take your stuff and leave. People are working here.</string>
    <string name="gameRulesBonusIII">This bomb will make devastation and destruction rain on the battlefield. It will touch (in addtion to the played cell) the cells on the top and the one on the bottom, and the one on the left and on the right too.\nWith one single shot.\nIt\'s the devastation (and destruction) freaks\' bonus.</string>

    <string name="gameRulesEnd">Right, you now know as much as me, so get the heck out of here and go destroy some tetrominos !\nPlease also note that no platypus was injured during the development of this game - although we always kept a whip for reach (just in case).</string>
    <string name="gameRulesPS">All the development team would like to apologize to the fierce supporters of this noble animal that is the platypus. This last mindless remark does not reflect our convictions and we assure you that we feel only the most profound respect for this stupid creature.</string>
